# Changelog

## 5.6.0

### Minor Changes

- support array of minimizers for `minify` and `terserOptions` (by [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) in [#674](https://github.com/webpack/minimizer-webpack-plugin/pull/674))

- add built-in CSS minimizers from `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin` (by [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) in [#674](https://github.com/webpack/minimizer-webpack-plugin/pull/674))

- add built-in HTML minimizers from `html-minimizer-webpack-plugin` (by [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) in [#674](https://github.com/webpack/minimizer-webpack-plugin/pull/674))

- add `filter` method to minimizers, allowing a single plugin instance to handle multiple asset types (by [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) in [#674](https://github.com/webpack/minimizer-webpack-plugin/pull/674))

- terser-webpack-plugin has been renamed to minimizer-webpack-plugin, merging other minimizers from css-minimizer-webpack-plugin and html-minimizer-webpack-plugin. We will continue to publish new releases under the old name, but we recommend switching to the new package - minimizer-webpack-plugin. It is now a single plugin for minification. We also added the ability to specify different minifier types using only one plugin instance, which will improve performance. (by [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) in [#677](https://github.com/webpack/minimizer-webpack-plugin/pull/677))

- rename `terserOptions` to `minimizerOptions`; `terserOptions` is kept as a deprecated alias (by [@alexander-akait](https://github.com/alexander-akait) in [#674](https://github.com/webpack/minimizer-webpack-plugin/pull/674))

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.
